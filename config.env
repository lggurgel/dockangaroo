# Bitcoin Puzzle Solver - Configuration
# ================================

# PUZZLE CONFIGURATION
# Which Bitcoin puzzle to solve (see https://privatekeys.pw/puzzles/bitcoin-puzzle-tx)
PUZZLE_NUMBER=135

# Target public key (compressed, 33 bytes hex)
# For Puzzle 135:
TARGET_PUBLIC_KEY=02145d2611c823a396ef6712ce0f712f09b9b4f3135e3e0aa3230fb9b6d08d1e16

# Search range is automatically calculated as: 2^(PUZZLE_NUMBER-1) to 2^PUZZLE_NUMBER - 1
# For Puzzle 135: 2^134 to 2^135 - 1

# WORKER CONFIGURATION
# Number of parallel workers to run
NUM_WORKERS=10

# KANGAROO ALGORITHM SETTINGS
# Distinguished Point bits (affects speed vs memory tradeoff)
# Lower = more DPs saved = better collision detection = faster
# Higher = fewer DPs saved = less memory = slower but more stable
# Recommended: 18-22 for puzzle 135, 10-14 for smaller puzzles
DP_BITS=18

# Work file save interval (seconds)
# How often to save progress to disk
WORK_SAVE_INTERVAL=60

# DOCKER RESOURCE LIMITS
# CPU cores per worker (adjust based on your system)
# Total CPU usage = CPUS_PER_WORKER × NUM_WORKERS
# For 10-core system: use 1.0 (10 × 1.0 = 10 cores)
# For 8-core system: use 0.8 (10 × 0.8 = 8 cores)
# For 16-core system: use 1.6 (10 × 1.6 = 16 cores)
CPUS_PER_WORKER=1.0

# Memory per worker (in GB)
# Kangaroo doesn't need much RAM
MEMORY_PER_WORKER=2

# GPU CONFIGURATION (Advanced - for cloud deployment only)
# Enable GPU acceleration (requires NVIDIA GPU with CUDA)
GPU_ENABLED=0

# GPU device ID (if multiple GPUs available)
GPU_DEVICE=0
